# ---------------------------- Container Commands ------------------------------
# You can use the container_commands key to execute commands for your container.
# The commands in container_commands are processed in alphabetical order by
# name. They run after the application and web server have been set up and the
# application version file has been extracted, but before the application
# version is deployed. They also have access to environment variables such as
# your AWS security credentials. Additionally, you can use leader_only. One
# instance is chosen to be the leader in an Auto Scaling group. If the
# leader_only value is set to true, the command runs only on the instance
# that is marked as the leader.
#
# Artisan commands include environment flag for production. If you are not
# deploying to a production environment, update the flag.
